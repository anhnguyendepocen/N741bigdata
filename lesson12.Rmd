## Supervised Learning

The easiest way to think about supervised learning is that you have a "target" or set of group classes already defined and you want to create a model that defines or predicts these classes (or "target").

Last week you already learned one such method - logistic regression (and really even linear regression) are "supervised" learning methods, since both create models that "best explain or define" the relationship of the predictor/independent variables with your "target" or "outcome" of interest. 

Today's lecture will expand upon those principles with additional supervised learning/modeling methods.
