## Hands-On

Not it is your turn to try everything out.

## Github

* Login to your Github Account
* Fork this repository [https://github.com/melindahiggins2000/N741exercise01](https://github.com/melindahiggins2000/N741exercise01)
* Go to your Github Account

## Connect with GIT

* Read sections in [Happy Git and Github for the UserR](http://happygitwithr.com/) - specifically Chapter 8 on Introducing Yourself to GIT [http://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html](http://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html)
* Run Git and type in the commands to introduce yourself (create your credentials on your computer)

## On Local Computer

* Create a folder that you will use for all of the projects and assignments in this course (e.g. `C:/N741`).

## Run RStudio

* Go to Tools/Global options, click on GIT/SVN - make sure your computer "sees" the GIT executable - on my computer it is `C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe`
* Create New Project, Using Version Control, GIT
* From the Github repository, copy the URL to the clipboard, and make sure you create the project as a subdirectory of the folder you created for this course (e.g. `C:/N741`).

## Make some changes and sync with Github

* Open the README.md file
* Make some changes - add a sentence or two
* Notice the changes in the GIT TAB top right
* We will follow 3 steps:
    * Add/Stage
    * Commit
    * PUSH
* Try using the RStudio GIT TAB
* and we'll run again using the Terminal Window (or the GIT application)
