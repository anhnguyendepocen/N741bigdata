## Outline

1. "Data"
2. Documentation
3. Organization
4. Automation
5. Dissemination

## Data - "for example..."

* often thought of as numbers in a spreadsheet
* can be unstructured text
* images
* video and other media
* interview transcripts
* artwork
* and any other "RAW" materials needed to complete your project

## Data - "should be..."

* high quality
* reviewed for completeness
* reviewed for mistakes and errors 
* checked for changes or updates
    - ideally, your final reproducible workflow will allow up these changes and updates to be automatically updates into your final products

## Documentation

* main component is text
* well written
* good organization and flow
* easily accessible
* understood by team members at all levels
* code + text + figures combined [e.g. literate programming]
* at end, formatting styles applied via "markup/markdown"

## Organization

* projects grow
* supporting documentation and files - numerous
* relationships change and can grow more complex
* need file organization and naming schemes
* file names should be:
    - readable by the computer, easy to search, easy to sort (especially by date and author if needed)
    - human readable with logical naming schemes and contain enough info so human knows what is in the file/what the file is for
    - and short enough to be reasonably manageable
* consider user-based access and security (partitioned by "need to know" _[users with editing and write permissions versus users with read-only access]_

## Automation

* at a minimum, a diagram or instructions for workflow should be documented on how the components are to be assembled for your final product
* write code/scripts to automate
    - data raw to processed output
    - creating and removing temporary files
    - creating tables, figures, other components
    - assembling the components into final documents, products
    - rendering documents into multiple/desired formats
    
## Dissemination - Why?

* store and share your data and code â€“ even if it is only for your future reference
* sometimes expectation/requirement of funding agency, publisher
* increased visibility, you as source - default subject matter expert
* speed of collaboration - faster advancement of science, knowledge
* good will with community/public

## Dissemination - How?

* Cloud-based "File Storage"
    - Dropbox [https://www.dropbox.com/](https://www.dropbox.com/)
    - Google drive [https://www.google.com/drive/](https://www.google.com/drive/)
    - Github (better with version control and tracking) [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
* Data repositories 
    - GenBank [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)
    - PDB [https://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do](https://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do)
* In addition to Github
    - Bitbucket [https://bitbucket.org/](https://bitbucket.org/)
    - Dryad [http://datadryad.org/](http://datadryad.org/)
    - Figshare [https://figshare.com/](https://figshare.com/)
    - Zenodo [https://zenodo.org/](https://zenodo.org/)
        
## Dissemination - Who? _(e.g. stakeholders)_
   
* Yourself
* Your organization - internal reports
* Journals - articles, manuscripts
* Books
* Blogs/Websites
* RSS feeds
* Rpubs [https://rpubs.com/](https://rpubs.com/)
* Gitbook [https://www.gitbook.com/](https://www.gitbook.com/)
* Bookdown [https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)
