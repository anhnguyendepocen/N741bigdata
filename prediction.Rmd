## Lecture/Lesson on Prediction

Today's lesson will focus on the details and considerations for predictive modeling. Some useful links are:

* Website for book "Clinical Prediction Models" by Ewout W. Steyerberg, see [http://www.clinicalpredictionmodels.org/](http://www.clinicalpredictionmodels.org/)
* also see the "seven steps for development and an ABCD for validation" paper based on the GUSTO dataset, posted at [http://www.clinicalpredictionmodels.org/doku.php?id=rcode_and_data:start](http://www.clinicalpredictionmodels.org/doku.php?id=rcode_and_data:start)
* additional presentations by these authors, see [http://www.clinicalpredictionmodels.org/doku.php?id=presentations:start](http://www.clinicalpredictionmodels.org/doku.php?id=presentations:start)
* Also see the paper "To Explain or to Predict" by Galit Shmueli [https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/shmueli.pdf](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/shmueli.pdf); Statistical Science; 2010, Vol. 25, No. 3, 289â€“310; DOI: 10.1214/10-STS330.
* There is also a helpful "cheatsheet" for Predictive Modeling at [https://dzone.com/refcardz/machine-learning-predictive](https://dzone.com/refcardz/machine-learning-predictive). _Note: D-zone requires you to subscribe to access/download the PDF._
