## R Commander Tutorial

Towards the end of class today we will also run through a demonstration of the `Rcmdr` package. This package provides a wonderful interface for regression models, graphics and even helps with writing R code and Rmarkdown!!

* Install the `Rcmdr` package from CRAN - see [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcmdr/index.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcmdr/index.html)

* Learn more about R Commander at [https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/](https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/)

* Book on R Commander by John Fox [https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/RCommander/](https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/RCommander/)

* Specific details about installing it on MAC's and PC's (and even Linux) [https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/installation-notes.html](https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/installation-notes.html)
