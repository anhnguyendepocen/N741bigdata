## Machine Learning - Supervised Techniques (formerly Random Forest)

Today (03/15/2017) was originally planned to cover random forests, which is a supervised "machine learning" or "data mining" method. However, today's lecture/lesson will still cover Random Forests which is a supervised learning method. We will also cover classification and regression trees (precursor to random forests). We will also introduce the `rattle` package which has a nice GUI (graphical user interface) for performing "data mining" or "machine learning" methods - supervised and unsupervised (we'll cover next week).
