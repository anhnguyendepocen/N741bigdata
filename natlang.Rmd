## More Microbiome and AWS (formerly Natural Language Processing)

Today is the 2nd part of the lesson on working with microbiome data. 

We will be learning how to move beyond pretty bar plots and scatter plots of principal coordinates to learning about assessing function. Dr. Hertzberg will demonstrate a new tool that improves on `PICRUSt`, with no installation necessary.

FYI - Information on `PICRUSt` can be found at [http://picrust.github.io/picrust/](http://picrust.github.io/picrust/)
